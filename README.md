# MonsterHunter

This is an automatic armour set generator designed to work with Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.

## How does this work?

This project will ask you for the type of weapon you will be using (gunner or blademaster) and then will prompt you for the skill trees that you would like prioritised for your set. Once you are done inputting your skills, you need to type 'done' and then the armour set will be generated.

## Understanding the output

### Set

This section of the output simply shows the name of all the armour pieces that comprise the set that was generated for you.

### Current Skill Points

This section of the output shows the current points that the generated set would give you in each skill tree.

### Active Skills

This section of the ouput displays any skills that have had their threshold met to be activated. Any skills that don't appear are not activated yet and will require further modifications to activate.

### Required Points

This section is for any skills that you asked for but were not able to be activated with armour pieces alone. Skills in this section should use either talismans or decorations to reach the threshold and activate the skill.

### Recommended

This section is for any negative skills that may have been accidentally activated or any additional skills that are close to their activation threshold that could improve your set beyond what you initially intended.
